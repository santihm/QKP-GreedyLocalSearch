# QKP-GreedyLocalSearch
Implementation of Greedy and Local Search Algorithms for Quadratic Knapsack Problem

This project contains the implementation of greedy and local search algorithms to solve the Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP), a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. The QKP involves selecting a combination of items to maximize the total value while staying within the knapsack's weight capacity, taking into account quadratic dependencies between items.

The algorithms implemented include a Greedy algorithm, which iteratively selects the most promising item based on a heuristic, and various Local Search algorithms, such as First Best, Double First Best with Extended Neighbor Generation, Best Neighbor, and Double Best Neighbor with Extended Neighbor Generation.

The repository includes C++ source code for the algorithms, along with scripts to run experiments on different problem instances, analyze results, and compare algorithm performance. Each algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness are evaluated based on the quality of solutions obtained and the computational time required.

This project serves as a learning resource for students and practitioners interested in understanding and implementing optimization algorithms for combinatorial problems, particularly the Quadratic Knapsack Problem.
